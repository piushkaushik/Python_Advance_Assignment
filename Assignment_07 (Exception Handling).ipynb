    "The `try` statement in Python is used to define a block of code that may potentially raise an exception or error during its execution. Its primary purpose is to handle exceptions gracefully, allowing you to write code that can respond to errors or exceptional conditions without crashing the entire program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The `try` block contains the code that might raise an exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. If an exception occurs within the `try` block, Python immediately jumps to the corresponding `except` block(s) that handle that type of exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. If no exception occurs, the `except` block(s) are skipped, and the program continues executing after the `try...except` statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main purposes of the `try` statement are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Error Handling**: It allows you to catch and handle exceptions, preventing the program from terminating unexpectedly due to errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Graceful Degradation**: It enables your program to continue executing even when it encounters errors, allowing it to provide useful feedback or take alternative actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Resource Cleanup**: You can use `try` with the `finally` block to ensure that certain resources (like file handles or network connections) are properly closed or released, regardless of whether an exception occurred."
