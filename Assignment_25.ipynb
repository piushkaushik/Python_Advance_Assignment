    "Numpy arrays and pandas DataFrames are both data structures used for handling and manipulating data, but they have distinct differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Numpy Array:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Numpy is a library for numerical computations, and its primary data structure is the numpy array.\n",
    "- Numpy arrays are homogeneous, meaning they can only contain elements of a single data type (e.g., integers, floats).\n",
    "- They are typically used for mathematical operations and numerical data.\n",
    "- Numpy arrays are efficient for element-wise operations and numerical computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pandas DataFrame:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Pandas is a library built on top of numpy, specifically designed for data manipulation and analysis.\n",
    "- DataFrames are two-dimensional, tabular data structures, which are more flexible than numpy arrays.\n",
    "- DataFrames can hold heterogeneous data types within a single structure.\n",
    "- They are equipped with powerful indexing and labeling features, making them suitable for data cleaning, exploration, and analysis.\n",
    "- DataFrames are commonly used for working with structured data like CSV files, Excel spreadsheets, and SQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conversion:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- We can convert a pandas DataFrame to a numpy array using the `.values` attribute of a DataFrame. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you have a DataFrame called `df`, you can obtain a numpy array by calling `df.values`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Converting a numpy array to a pandas DataFrame is straightforward. You can use the `pd.DataFrame()` constructor and pass the numpy array as an argument. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, `pd.DataFrame(numpy_array)` will create a DataFrame from the numpy array.\n"

    "2. **Network Errors:** When making API calls to fetch stock data, network errors can occur, leading to failed requests or timeouts. Implement proper error handling and retry mechanisms to address network issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Data Unavailability:** Stock data for certain symbols may not be available due to various reasons, such as delisting, temporary unavailability, or data provider limitations. You should check for data availability and provide appropriate feedback to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **User Input Sanitization:** Sanitize user inputs to prevent malicious input, such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "To handle these issues:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Provide informative error messages to users when they enter an invalid symbol or when there are data retrieval problems.\n",
    "- Implement robust error handling and logging to monitor and troubleshoot issues.\n",
    "- Use try-except blocks or error-handling functions to gracefully manage exceptions.\n",
    "- Implement caching mechanisms to store previously fetched data and reduce the load on external APIs.\n",
