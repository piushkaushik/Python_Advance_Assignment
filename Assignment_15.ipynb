    "Python 3.8 introduced several new features and improvements, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Assignment Expressions (the \"walrus operator\"): This allows you to assign values to variables as part of an expression using `:=`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Positional-Only Parameters: You can now specify that certain function parameters must be passed as positional arguments and cannot be specified as keyword arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. f-strings Improvements: New features and syntax improvements for formatted string literals (f-strings).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. `__future__` Annotations: The `__future__` module allows you to enable or disable certain language features to make code compatible with future Python versions.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Syntax Warning Framework: Python 3.8 introduced a more flexible and extensible syntax warning framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. New Syntax Features: Including the \"b\" and \"f\" qualifiers for literals (e.g., `0b101` for binary literals and `f'{x}'` for formatted string literals).\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Performance Improvements: Python 3.8 includes various performance optimizations and improvements.\n",

    "Monkey patching in Python refers to the practice of dynamically modifying or extending the behavior of classes, modules, or functions at runtime, often without altering their original source code. \n",
    "\n",
    "This technique is typically used to fix bugs, add new functionality, or modify the behavior of existing code without directly modifying the source files.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some key points about monkey patching:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Dynamic Modifications:** Monkey patching allows developers to make changes to code on the fly, without waiting for official updates or access to the original source code.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Common Use Cases:**\n",
    "   - Fixing Bugs: You can patch existing code to fix bugs or security vulnerabilities.\n",
    "   - Adding Features: You can extend the functionality of libraries or modules by adding new methods or attributes.\n",
    "   - Changing Behavior: You can modify the behavior of functions or classes to suit your specific needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Risk and Caution:** While monkey patching can be a powerful tool, it should be used with caution. Overuse or misuse can lead to maintenance challenges, unexpected side effects, and compatibility issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Readability and Documentation:** It's essential to document monkey patches thoroughly to make the code more understandable for other developers. Without proper documentation, monkey patches can become hard to maintain and debug.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Alternative Approaches:** In some cases, monkey patching may not be the best solution. Alternatives include subclassing, using decorators, or creating wrapper functions to achieve the desired functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Testing:** Proper testing is crucial when using monkey patching to ensure that the modified code behaves as expected and does not introduce new issues.\n",
