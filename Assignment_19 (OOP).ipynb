    "Python supports a limited form of encapsulation by using naming conventions rather than strict access control like some other programming languages. Here's how it works:\n",

    "1. **Public:** If a variable or method name starts with an underscore (`_`), it is considered a non-public part of the API. However, it can still be accessed from outside the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Protected:** Python doesn't have a strict \"protected\" access modifier like some other languages. By convention, variables and methods prefixed with a double underscore (`__`) are considered protected, but they are still accessible if you know the name mangling rules (e.g., `_ClassName__variable`). However, it's generally discouraged to access such attributes directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Private:** Variables and methods that start with double underscores (`__`) and end with at most one trailing underscore (`_`) are considered private. They undergo name mangling (e.g., `_ClassName__variable`). This makes it harder to access them from outside the class, but they are not entirely private.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So, Python supports encapsulation to some extent but relies on naming conventions and developer discipline rather than strict access control. The philosophy is often summarized as \"We are all consenting adults here,\" meaning that developers are trusted to follow conventions and not misuse or access private parts of classes."
