    "Exception processing is a crucial aspect of error handling in programming. Here are three common applications for exception processing:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Error Handling**: The primary purpose of exceptions is to handle errors gracefully. When unexpected situations or errors occur during program execution, exceptions provide a mechanism to catch and manage these errors. For example, if a file that a program is trying to read doesn't exist, it can raise a `FileNotFoundError` exception and handle it by providing an appropriate error message or taking corrective actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Input Validation**: Exceptions can be used to validate user input. For instance, if a user is expected to enter a number, and they input a non-numeric value, an exception (e.g., `ValueError`) can be raised to indicate the input is invalid. This allows the program to prompt the user for valid input or take other actions as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Resource Management**: Exceptions are essential for managing resources like files, network connections, or database connections. If, for some reason, the program can't access a resource or encounters an issue while using it, it can raise an exception. This allows the program to release or close the resource properly before terminating or taking recovery measures."

    "\n",
    "3. **Graceful Termination:** Depending on the nature of the exception, you might decide to exit the script gracefully rather than attempting to recover. You can use the `sys.exit()` function to exit the script with a specified exit code.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Error Handling and Reporting:** You can design your script to handle errors in a way that informs the user or operator about the issue. This could involve printing error messages, sending email notifications, or displaying user-friendly error dialogs.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Exception Propagation:** In some cases, it's appropriate to let the exception propagate up the call stack to a higher-level handler or even to the main script. This can be useful when the exception cannot be handled effectively at a lower level.\n",
    "\n",
