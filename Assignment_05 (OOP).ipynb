    "Composition is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that involves building complex objects by combining or \"composing\" simpler objects. It allows you to create more modular, reusable, and flexible code by assembling objects with different functionalities to form more complex structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some key points about the concept of composition:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Composition vs. Inheritance:** Composition is an alternative to inheritance for achieving code reuse and building complex objects. While inheritance involves creating new classes by inheriting properties and behaviors from existing classes, composition involves creating objects by combining other objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Has-A Relationship:** Composition represents a \"has-a\" relationship, meaning that an object contains or is composed of other objects. For example, a `Car` object has an `Engine`, `Wheels`, and `Seats`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Modularity:** Composition promotes modularity in your code. You can create small, self-contained classes that represent specific functionalities or components. These classes can then be combined to create more complex objects or systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Flexibility:** With composition, you can easily change the behavior of an object by replacing or reconfiguring its components. This makes your code more adaptable to changing requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Encapsulation:** Each component in a composition can encapsulate its own state and behavior. This helps in maintaining a clear separation of concerns and reduces complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Code Reusability:** By composing objects, you can reuse components in different contexts, reducing code duplication."

    "Pseudoprivate attributes, often referred to as \"name mangling\" in Python, serve a specific purpose in class design. They are meant to provide a level of name protection for attributes within a class. The purpose of pseudoprivate attributes can be summarized as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Name Protection:** Pseudoprivate attributes are used to protect attribute names from unintentional name conflicts with subclasses or other classes. They help prevent accidental overwriting of attributes by subclasses or external code.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "3. **Avoiding Name Clashes:** By adding double underscores as a prefix to an attribute name (e.g., `__my_attribute`), you make it harder for other developers to accidentally override or access the attribute directly. This can help avoid name clashes and maintain the internal integrity of the class.\n",
